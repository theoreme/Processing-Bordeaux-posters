Processing Bordeaux posters
===========================

[Processing Bordeaux](http://www.processingbordeaux.org/) was a monthly free event taking place every Tuesday evening each month at the [I.Boat](http://www.iboat.eu) in Bordeaux (France) and was open to all creatives interested in meeting up and sharing their passion about open source creative technologies.
Fourteen sessions happened from January 2012 to June 2013. Each time a professional in the field of digital creation was invited to present his work and lead a small workshop on a specific subject. 

For Processing Bordeaux #07 up to #14, a serie of posters was created in collaboration with graphic design agency [Kubik](http://www.kubik.fr). Each poster was composed after a pattern generated in a dedicated tool, made with [Processing](http://www.processing.org) of course.
